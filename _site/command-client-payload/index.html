<p class="content">
  The bread &amp; butter of applications written on top of this framework should be implementations of <code>WebsocketCommand</code>;
  a very simple interface that requires you to provide a name and a method that will be called whenever a Client requests
  the command to be executed. If it helps you think about it a WebsocketCommand is generally analogous to a Controller in
  traditional HTTP frameworks.
</p>

<h3 class="subtitle is-size-4">WebsocketCommand::getName</h3>

<p class="content">
  It is important to take a little time to discuss the name of your command because naming things is important. It is
  good to keep in mind when naming your commands that a user will need to use the exact name to execute it. Your command
  should be concise and explicit. Generally speaking we suggest you follow the below conventions when naming based on
  whether you anticipate sharing your command with the community or using it in a private app.
</p>

<h4 class="is-size-5">Community Shared Commands</h4>

<p class="content">
  When you are building a library that you expect to share with the community we recommend that you allow the name to be
  configured at construction time through a dependency while also providing a sane default. The reasoning for this is that
  the application using your command should define the structure for how clients interact with it. Also we recommend that
  your name include a vendor and/or app namespace such that default values have the following format:
</p>

<pre class="content">vendor.command-name</pre>

<div class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-header">
    Note
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
    Generally speaking we do not recommend that you add a vendor and app namespace because of the need to balance between
    reasonably unique command names and end-user experience.
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class="is-size-5">Private Commands</h4>

<p class="content">
  Obviously private commands are less important regarding namespacing; if your command is not shared with the community
  and as long as community commands you do include adhere to the above guidelines your private commands can truly be
  whatever you'd like them to be. However, we recommend that you maintain consistency with the format of the name and
  simply exclude the vendor and/or app namespacing.
</p>

<pre class="content">command-name</pre>

<h3 class="subtitle is-size-4">WebsocketCommand::execute</h3>

<p class="content">
  The execute method is where all of your command's business logic will go. It should return a Promise that resolves with
  null upon completion or fails if an exception is thrown. Two arguments will be passed; the first being an <code>Amp\Websocket\Client</code>
  and the second being a <code>Cspray\WebsocketCommands\ClientPayload</code>. There are no guidelines or recommendations
  on what your command does... just remember not to block the event loop!
</p>

<h3 class="subtitle is-size-4">ClientPayload</h3>

<p class="content">
  Instead of providing the raw Message contents we do additional parsing of it and turn it from a JSON encoded string into a
  <code>Cspray\WebsocketCommands\ClientPayload</code> instance. This implementation makes use of
  <a href="http://github.com/adbario/php-dot-notation">adbario/php-dot-notation</a> to simplify the retrieval of arbitrarily
  nested arrays. I highly recommend that you read the documentation for this library as it allows for some pretty concise
  interactions with array structures.
