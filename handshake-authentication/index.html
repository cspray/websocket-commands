<h2 class="title is-size-2">Handshake Authentication</h2>

<p class="content">
  Handshake authentication takes care of making sure that the Websocket is authenticated properly during the handshake
  procedure. You can conceptually think of this as handling the traditional HTTP request before websocket communication
  begins. You can interrogate a Request object and set the status code, headers, and/or cookies for the Response.

<h3 class="subtitle is-size-4">HandshakeAuthenticator::onHandshake</h3>

<p class="content">
  This method must return a Promise that should resolve with the Response object. It accepts 2 arguments; the first being
  an <code>Amp\Http\Server\Request</code> which can be used to interrogate headers, cookies, or query parameters and the
  second being an <code>Amp\Http\Server\Response</code> which can be used to set status code, headers, and/or cookies. If
  the Response status code is set to a non-2XX response the websocket connection will be terminated.
