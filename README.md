# Websocket Commands

A micro-framework to facilitate building applications using [amphp/websocket-server].

## Installation

We recommend using [Composer] to install this library.

```
composer require cspray/websocket-commands
```

## Requirements

- PHP +7.2

## Documentation

The library's currently released version is documented in-source and at [websocket-commands.cspray.io].

## Roadmap

The **1.x** releases of this project are intended to slidify the API while several Amp packages are going their Release 
Candidate phase. Once those dependent libraries have stable versions released the **2.0** release development will start.
The exact features for the initial 2.0 release are detailed in the [Release 2.0 Project]
