## Supported Versions

This project currently supports the following versions. The timeline for supporting each version has not been
determined as it is reliant somewhat on external dependencies. For now you can assume that each version listed 
will have security updates supported for the foreseeable future.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you find a security vulnerability in code that I have created 
please **do not open a public issue** and instead contact me directly at [security@cspray.io](mailto:security@cspray.io).
This email is hosted on a service using end-to-end encryption and I will respond within 24 hours of receiving any email 
at this address. We will then discuss further on exactly what needs to be done to resolve the vulnerability to the satsifaction 
of all parties.
